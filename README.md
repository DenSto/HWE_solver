## Dependencies 

The script as it stands uses the inferno colormap [which can be obtained
here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/51986-perceptually-uniform-colormaps),
as well as colorbrewer's Red/Blue colormap using Charles Robert's implementation.

The script that writes out the fields to gnuplot binary matrix format [can be obtained 
here](http://www.gnuplotting.org/code/save_binary_matrix.m).

## Using the script

All the input parameters are set at the beginning of the script, where comments have been
provided describing what each parameter is responsible for.
